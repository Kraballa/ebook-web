# ebook-web 
ebook-web is an entirely client-side web based epub reader. Select an ebook from your harddrive and begin reading! A version is hosted on my website at https://ebook.kraballa.net/.

roadmap:
- [x] read epub files, display images, use styles
- [ ] settings interface
- [ ] provide an alternative to iframes so custom stylings and extensions can still interact with the book content 
- [ ] bookmarking system

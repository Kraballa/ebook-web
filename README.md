# ebook-web 
ebook-web is an entirely client-side web based epub reader. Select an ebook from your harddrive and begin reading! A version is hosted on my website at https://ebook.kraballa.net/.

This project attempts to serve as an alternative to similar projects like calibre [calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) or [reader.ttsu](https://github.com/ttu-ttu/ebook-reader) (coincidentally also svelte) by remaining minimal and fast.

# roadmap:
- [x] read epub files, display images, use styles
- [x] bookmarking system
- [ ] settings interface
    - [ ] no styling (maybe allow custom styling rules)
    - [ ] no images
    - [ ] auto bookmarking
